# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
The **Iris Flower Classification** project uses the famous Iris dataset to classify flowers into one of three species: **setosa**, **versicolor**, and **virginica**. The dataset contains sepal and petal measurements, which are used as features to train and evaluate machine learning models.

This project demonstrates the fundamental steps of data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:

1. **sepal_length**: Length of the sepal (in cm).
2. **sepal_width**: Width of the sepal (in cm).
3. **petal_length**: Length of the petal (in cm).
4. **petal_width**: Width of the petal (in cm).
5. **species**: The species of the Iris flower (target variable) with three possible values:
   - **setosa**
   - **versicolor**
   - **virginica**

## Project Steps

### 1. Load the Dataset
Read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and inspect its structure.

### 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Inspect for missing values or anomalies.
- Visualize the data using plots to understand feature distributions and relationships.

### 3. Split Data
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 4. Train a Classification Model
Train machine learning models using algorithms like:
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest

### 5. Evaluate the Model
Assess model performance using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

### 6. Make Predictions
Use the trained model to classify new Iris flower measurements.

## Visualization
The project includes the following visualizations:
- Pair plots for feature relationships.
- Correlation heatmaps for feature dependency.
